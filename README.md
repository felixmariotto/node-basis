# node-basis
Simple wrapper around a [basis-universal](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal) executable.   

Basis Universal is a "supercompressed" GPU texture and texture video compression system that outputs a highly compressed intermediate file format (.basis) that can be quickly transcoded to a wide variety of GPU texture compression formats.
